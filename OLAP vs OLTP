Relational Databases - OLAP vs OLTP

a. OLAP and OLTP use similar data structures
b. BUT very different approach in how data is stored
c. OLTP databases use row storage
     * Each table row is stored together
     * Efficient for processing small transactions
d. OLAP databases use columnar storage
     * Each table column is stored together
     * High compression - store petabytes of data efficiently
     * Distribute data - one table in multiple cluster nodes
     * Execute single query across multiple nodes -
     * Complex queries can be executed efficiently
